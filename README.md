## _Implementation of Euler modified equation into jump feature_

In this project, i made a 2D platform game and implemented for the **jump** feature an equation from this [2016 GDC talk]. On it, Kyle Pittman shows how to construct natural-feeling jump trajectories from designer-friendly input like desired height and distance, modeled programmatically using one of a few available integration methods.
